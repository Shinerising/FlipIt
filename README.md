# Flip It!
A Android game that test how many times the phone flipped after you toss it.

It's a little game I wrote just for fun. You can download it at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.wayshine.apollo.flipit

Caution: if you want to test this project on your own devices, you need to do more things than only download the codes and resouces.
For potential security issue, I remove the string.xml in res folder which is used for recording all the strings in the project. 
You must add your own strings or create a new string.xml. (in fact the IDE would remind you to do that)
And, I used Google Play Services in this game(for enabling leaderboard and achievements), you can disable the functions about Google Play Services or setup them on your own(see this for more details: https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview).

This game doesn't work very well(cuz the motion sensor on cellphone doesn't work perfectly). but I still think it's funny and worthy to have a try. Hope you like it!
